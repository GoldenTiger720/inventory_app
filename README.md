### Database Architecture

#### SQLite Database Schema
The app uses SQLite for local data storage with the following tables:

**Users Table**
- Stores user authentication and profile information
- Password hashing using SHA-256 for security
- Supports multiple user roles

**Products Table**
- Pre-loaded with sample inventory items
- Supports barcode scanning and search functionality
- Tracks pricing, quantities, and locations

**Inventory Counts Table**
- Manages inventory counting sessions
- Tracks expected vs counted quantities
- Supports variance detection

**Order Items Table**
- Queue for POS integration
- Links products to users
- Maintains order history

### API Integration (Optional)
The app can also consume the following SGW system endpoints when available:

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh

#### Product Management
- `GET /products/code/{code}` - Get product by barcode/code
- `GET /products/search` - Search products by description
- `PUT /products/{id}` - Update product information

#### Order Management
- `POST /orders/queue` - Add product to order queue
- `DELETE /orders/queue/{productId}` - Remove product from queue

#### Inventory Management
- `POST /inventory/start-count` - Initialize inventory counting session
- `GET /inventory/items-for-count` - Retrieve items pending count
- `GET /inventory/counted-items` - Retrieve completed counts
- `PUT /inventory/count/{itemId}` - Update item count
- `POST /inventory/send-for-count` - Add item to counting list
- `DELETE /inventory/remove-from-count/{itemId}` - Remove from counting
